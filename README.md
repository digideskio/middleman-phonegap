  or https://github.com/phonegap/ios-sim

## Installation / Phonegap Integration ##
 
1. Clone **middleman-phonegap** into `~/.middleman`. You will need to create this directory if it doesn't exist.
   `$ git clone git://github.com/pixelsonly/middleman-phonegap.git ~/.middleman/middleman-phonegap`
   
2. Download and install [Phonegap](http://phonegap.com/download/) if you haven't already

3. Create a Phonegap project by running the *create* command, [see docs for help](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.3.0/guide_command-line_index.md.html#Command-Line%20Usage_ios)
   `$ ./path/to/cordova-ios/bin/create /path/to/new_phonegap_project com.example.cordova_project_name PhonegapProjectName`

4. Initialize Middleman with the template on the Phonegap project you just created
   `$ middleman init existing_phonegap_project --template=middleman-phonegap`

## Build Tool ##
**middleman-phonegap** hooks into the Middleman build process, merges the compiled assets with the Phonegap structure, compiles the iOS application and launches the iOS Simulator with a single command.
 
 Run `$ middleman build` from project root

**Only supports iOS (for now)**
